# StockXChange
An Android game currently in development to serve as a work example, to showcase my skills as an Android developer.

To view the main files go to https://github.com/Twilight-Hacker/StockXChange/tree/master/app/src/main .

To view Screenshots of the app go to https://github.com/Twilight-Hacker/StockXChange/tree/master/Screenshots . New Screenshots Uploaded.

The code is a little inconsistent because the basis of this project is to show my abilities. I realise that this is not a good practice. This game is meant as a work example, and this is why, even after it is launched, it will forever remain free.

As of 26 Nov 2015 the Testing (and debugging) of the App is complete. Going through final checklists to upload to Google Play. Net Commit will most likely be on this file with the link to Google Play).

This code is published under the current (highest) version GPL Licence.

You may use this code as you see fit, as long as you attribute it to the developer (Fragkas P. Vasileios).
